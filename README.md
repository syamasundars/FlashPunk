### The _total_ package.

Not only is FlashPunk absolutely free, it also contains everything you'll need to make the game you want. From its robust and dead-simple sprite-based graphics handling to its powerful live debugger, you won't need a team of berets and neckbeards to make your game come to life.

Features
--------

### Graphics

Helper classes for animations, tilemaps, text, backdrops, and more with z-sorted render lists for easy depth management.

``` actionscript
// Create a new Image from imported image.
[Embed(source = 'player.png')]
private const PLAYER_IMAGE:Class;
var playerImage:Image = new Image(PLAYER_IMAGE);
```

### Collision

Fast and manageable rectangle, pixel, and grid collision system with a plethora of built-in collision options.

``` actionscript
// Check for collision between the player and all enemies.
var touchedEnemy:Entity = player.collide("enemy", player.x, player.y);
```

### Motion

Powerful motion tweening for linear, curved, and path-based movement as well as spritesheet support and image transformation.

``` actionscript
// Move an enemy across the screen with a tween, stopping against walls.
enemy.moveBy(5, 0, "wall");
```

### Audio

Sound effect support with volume, panning, and fading/crossfading, complete with one-line sound playback.

``` actionscript
// Play a shoot sound.
[Embed(source = 'shoot.mp3')] private const SHOOT:Class;
var shoot:Sfx = new Sfx(SHOOT);
shoot.play();
```

### Particles

Quick and efficient particle effects and emitters allow for beautiful particle systems without slowing things down.

### Timesteps

Framerate-independent and fixed-framerate timestep support allow you to decide what mode is best for you and your game.

``` actionscript
// Add the frame time to a timer.
timer += FP.elapsed;
```

### Input

Simple keyboard and mouse input state checking makes setting keys and events incredibly easy, yet powerful.

``` actionscript
// Call a function when Space is pressed.
if (Input.pressed(Key.Space)) {
  spacebar();
}
```

### Built-in Debugging

Handy console for real-time debugging and information tracking. It even allows moving the camera and inspecting entities while playing!

``` actionscript
// Enable the debugger and watch the player's speed.
FP.console.enable();
FP.console.watch(player.speed);
```
